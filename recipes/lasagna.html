    <h2>A brief introduction</h2>
    <p>Lasagna is a wide, flat sheet of pasta. Lasagna can refer to either the type of 
        noodle or to the typical lasagna dish which is a dish made with several layers 
        of lasagna sheets with sauce and other ingredients, 
        such as meats and cheese, in between the lasagna noodles.</p>
    <p>A spinach lasagna recipe made with fresh spinach and plenty of cheese — ricotta, Romano, and mozzarella. 
        This cheesy, hearty lasagna can also be made without the spinach.</p>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol id="ordered-list">
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. 
            Add lasagna noodles and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. 
            Add mushrooms, onions, and garlic and cook until onions are tender; 
            drain excess liquid and cool.</li>
        <li>At the same time, bring a small pot of water to a boil; add spinach and simmer for 5 minutes. 
            Drain and cool slightly; squeeze out any excess liquid and finely chop.</li>
        <li>Combine ricotta cheese, Romano cheese, egg, salt, oregano, basil, and pepper in a bowl. 
            Add cooled mushroom mixture and spinach; beat with an electric mixer on low speed for 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Lay 5 lasagna noodles in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Spread 1/3 of the ricotta-spinach mixture over noodles, then sprinkle with 1 cup mozzarella cheese and 1/3 cup Parmesan cheese. 
            Spread 1 cup pasta sauce over top. Repeat layers two more times, then cover with aluminum foil.</li>
