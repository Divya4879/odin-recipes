    <h2>A brief introduction</h2>
    <p>A pancake is a thin, flat cake, made of batter and fried in a frying pan. 
        A traditional English pancake is very thin and is served immediately. 
        Golden syrup or lemon juice and caster sugar are the usual toppings for pancakes. 
        The pancake has a very long history and featured in cookery books as far back as 1439.</p>
    <p>Fluffy on the inside, crispy on the outside, and delicately flavored with bananas and vanilla , 
        these banana pancakes are phenomenal . I love them with a simple drizzle of maple syrup, 
        but if you want to dress them up, you can 
        top them with fresh sliced bananas and a dusting of confectioners’ sugar.</p>

            <h6>Mix</h6>
            <p>Combine your dry ingredients (flour, sugar, salt, baking powder) in one bowl and your wet ingredients (egg, milk, vegetable oil, mashed bananas) in another bowl.
                Add the dry ingredients to the bowl with the wet ingredients, then stir until they're incorporated. 
                It's OK if your batter is slightly lumpy.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h6>Cook</h6>
            <p>Pour the batter in ¼ cup portions onto a lightly oiled pan or griddle over medium-high heat.
                 Cook for a few minutes, flip with a spatula, and cook for another few minutes 
                 (or until each side is golden brown).</p>
        </li>
