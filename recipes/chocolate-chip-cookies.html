    <h2>A brief introduction</h2>
    <p>A chocolate chip cookie is a sweet baked treat that is recognized by its butter flavor and 
        the inclusion of chocolate chips.
         Some variations can include nuts, oatmeal or raisins as well.</p>
    <p>Just the smell of these cookies baking in the oven can boost your mood and make you feel happy. 
        Eating a chocolate chip cookie can also help to relieve stress and anxiety. 
        The carbohydrates in the cookie help to release serotonin, which is a “feel good” chemical in your brain.</p>
